I studied <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth?specialization=meta-front-end-developer">Meta</a>'s '<i>Front-end Development - HTML & CSS in Depth</i>' course to Learn HTML and CSS.

  As the final project of the course, I designed <i>Little Lemon</i> Website according to the structure given.
